# My Cosmos
An App that helps your mental health by suggesting different activities that improves your mood. This app can be opened on Android and iOS. This app was made in 2016 for the Technovation Challenge with an old version of Ionic. It was made by me when I was just learning how to code, so expect some bugs (if you are determined enough to test the code). Since I had little knowledge of coding organization, comments explaining sections of code are sparse. This is the link to the demo video for the app: https://youtu.be/xiT2jnBsH4M

## Testing
Sadly, at the moment this code cannot be tested. The version of ionic used to programm the app has outdated plugins that prevent the app from running on a newer version of ionic. </br>
If you would really like to try to run this code, then : dowload it, install ionic, cordova, angular; use serve --lab to open the web version (make sure to accept overwriting the xml files). </br>

Until the I possibly remake the app in a newer version of ionic, the app must be viewed from the video.
