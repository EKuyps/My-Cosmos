# My Cosmos
An App that helps your mental health by suggesting different activities that improves your mood. This app can be opened on Android and iOS. This app was made in 2016 with an old version of Ionic and was made by me when I was just learning how to code, so expect bugs. Since I had little knowledge of coding organization, comments explaining sections of code are sparse. This is the link to the demo video for the app: https://youtu.be/xiT2jnBsH4M

## Instructions

These are the instructions on how to view the app on a mobile phone:
* Download 'Ionic View' from the App or Google Play Store
* Open the app and click on the eye tab
* Enter the App ID : 8467c538 (Note: Sometimes the App crashes in Ionic view App)
