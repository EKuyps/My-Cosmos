# My Cosmos
An App that helps your mental health by suggesting different activities that improves your mood. This app can be opened on Android and iOS. This app was made in 2016 with an old version of Ionic and was made by me when I was just learning how to code, so expect bugs. Since I had little knowledge of coding organization, comments explaining sections of code are sparse. This is the link to the demo video for the app: https://youtu.be/xiT2jnBsH4M

## Testing
sadly, at the moment this code cannot be tested. The version of ionic used to programm the app has outdated plugins that prevent the app from running on a newer version of ionic. 

Until the creator possibly remakes the app in a newer version of ionic, the app must be viewed from the video.
